## FIRST PART  —> rest-api

OAuth2 with Node and SQLite https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/08/21/build-secure-rest-api-with-node

OK This is going to build the api …
https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/08/21/build-secure-rest-api-with-node#build-your-rest-api-with-node-express-sequelize-and-epilogue

The rest-api is using Sequelize that can be used to connect to postgres, mysql, mariadb, sqlite and sql server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more:

Instead of Epilogue that is not working in this site I found a couple of suggestions:
https://github.com/dchester/epilogue/issues/239
https://github.com/tommybananas/finale

Finale seems to be a replacement for Epilogue and it works properly with the examples.

I have to finish the course here because this was intended to use a special service called OKTA so I will try another option.

## SECOND PART —> rest-api-oauth2

This course seems to be using a special library called node-oauth2-server.
